## What is a TIP?
TIP stands for Thirstie Improvement Proposal. A TIP is a document that provides a forum for team members to propose features and processes that improve Thirstie's technology or operations. If you're familiar with the Python community's [PEP][pep] process, this should feel particularly familiar.

## TIP Types
1. A __Feature__ TIP proposes a new feature of the technology platform as well as the motivation behind it, a proposed implementation, and possible caveats.
2. An __Enhancement__ TIP describes a solution to a difficulty or complication in the technology platform. It similarly consists of a motivation, proposed solution, and any forseen downsides.
3. A __Process__ TIP describes an engineering or operational workflow.

## To Be Described Further:
How TIPs are proposed, how they're reviewed, TIP statuses

## TIP Structure
Each TIP should consist of the following:

1. Preamble -- metadata about the TIP, including the TIP number, a descriptive title, and the author.
2. Abstract -- a short description of the issue being addressed.
3. Specification -- the technical details of the changes to be made. This should include, when applicable, classes, data schemas, software libraries, etc.
4. Motivation -- a discussion of the motivation for the change
5. Trade-offs -- any technical solution has its downsides. A discussion of trade-offs shows that the merits of the solution have been carefully weighed against any drawbacks.
